# ReactJS / Firebase Demo

`npm install firebase --save`

A very simplified version of the code used in the React/Firebase lectures at [https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery)


You'll need to paste in your own Firebase config code in `const config = {...}`, located at  /src/firebase/firebase.utils.js, for it to work.
